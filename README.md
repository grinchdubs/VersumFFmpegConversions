# VersumFFmpegConversions

Here you have a script to convert a MP4 video for minting on Versum. 

ManualMint.bat is a batch script which will use the cli version of FFmpeg. You will need to modify the contents slightly. 
The 2 variables that need to be edited are [input_Filename] and [Frame#]
Once you have edited these variables, place the MP4 video in the same folder as this script and FFmpeg and run it.

It may take a while to create all the files but it create them all in the same folder that you are running it from.
